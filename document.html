                    Energy, a measure of the ability to do work, 
                    comes in many forms and can transform from one type to another.
                     Examples of stored or potential energy include batteries and water behind a dam. 
                     Objects in motion are examples of kinetic energy. 
                     Charged particles—such as electrons and protons—create electromagnetic fields when they move, 
                     and these fields transport the type of energy we call electromagnetic radiation,
                     or light.

                <p class="spam">
                    Mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves are two important ways 
                    that energy is transported in the world around us. Waves in water 
                    and sound waves in air are two examples of mechanical waves.
                     Mechanical waves are caused by a disturbance or vibration in matter, 
                     whether solid, gas, liquid, or plasma. Matter that waves are traveling through
                      is called a medium. Water waves are formed by vibrations 
                      in a liquid and sound waves are formed by vibrations in a gas (air). 
                      These mechanical waves travel through a medium by causing the molecules to bump into each other, 
                      like falling dominoes transferring energy from one to the next. 
                      Sound waves cannot travel in the vacuum of
                     space because there is no medium to transmit these mechanical waves.

                    Electricity can be static, like the energy that can make your hair stand on end. 
                    Magnetism can also be static, as it is in a refrigerator magnet. 
                    A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice-versa—the two are linked. 
                    These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. 
                    Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in that they do not require a medium to propagate. 
                    This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, 
                    but also through the vacuum of space.

                    In the 1860's and 1870's, a Scottish scientist named James Clerk Maxwell 
                    developed a scientific theory to explain electromagnetic waves. 
                    He noticed that electrical fields and magnetic fields can couple together 
                    to form electromagnetic waves. He summarized this relationship between electricity and 
                    magnetism into what are now referred to as "Maxwell's Equations."

                    Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, applied Maxwell's theories 
                    to the production and reception of radio waves. The unit of frequency of a radio wave -- 
                    one cycle per second -- 
                    is named the hertz, in honor of Heinrich Hertz.

                <p class="spam">
                    His experiment with radio waves solved two problems. 
                    First, he had demonstrated in the concrete, what Maxwell had only theorized — 
                    that the velocity of radio waves was equal to the velocity of light! 
                    This proved that radio waves were a form of light! Second, Hertz found out how to make 
                    the electric and magnetic fields detach themselves 
                    from wires and go free as Maxwell's waves — electromagnetic waves.

                    Light is made of discrete packets of energy called photons. 
                    Photons carry momentum, have no mass, and travel at the speed of light. 
                    All light has both particle-like and wave-like properties. 
                    How an instrument is designed to sense the light influences which of these properties are observed. 
                    An instrument that diffracts light into a spectrum for analysis is an example of observing the
                     wave-like property of light. 
                     The particle-like nature of light is observed by detectors used in 
                     digital cameras—individual photons liberate 
                    electrons that are used for the detection and storage of the image data.

                    One of the physical properties of light is that it can be polarized.
                     Polarization is a measurement of the electromagnetic field's alignment. 
                     In the figure above, the electric field (in red) is vertically polarized. 
                     Think of a throwing a Frisbee at a picket fence. In one orientation it will pass through, 
                     in another it will be rejected. 
                    This is similar to how sunglasses are able to eliminate glare by 
                    absorbing the polarized portion of the light.

                    The terms light, electromagnetic waves, and radiation all refer to the same 
                    physical phenomenon: electromagnetic energy. This energy can be described by frequency, wavelength, 
                    or energy. All three are related mathematically such that if you know one, 
                    you can calculate the other two. Radio and microwaves are usually described 
                    in terms of frequency (Hertz), infrared and visible light in terms of wavelength 
                    (meters), and x-rays and gamma rays in terms of energy (electron volts). 
                    This is a scientific convention that allows the convenient use of units 
                    that have numbers that are neither too large nor too small.

                    The number of crests that pass a given point within one second is described as 
                    the frequency of the wave. One wave—or cycle—per second is called a Hertz (Hz), 
                    after Heinrich Hertz who established the existence of radio waves. 
                    A wave with two cycles that pass a point in one second has a frequency of 2 Hz.

                    Electromagnetic waves have crests and troughs similar to those of ocean waves. 
                    The distance between crests is the wavelength. 
                    The shortest wavelengths are just fractions of the size of an atom, 
                    while the longest wavelengths scientists currently study can be larger than 
                    the diameter of our planet!

                    An electromagnetic wave can also be described in terms of its energy—in units of measure called electron volts 
                    (eV). An electron volt is the amount of kinetic energy needed to move an electron through one volt potential.
                     Moving along the spectrum from long to short wavelengths, energy increases as the wavelength shortens. 
                     Consider a jump rope with its ends being pulled up and down. 
                    More energy is needed to make the rope have more waves.

                    Light waves across the electromagnetic spectrum behave in similar ways. 
                    When a light wave encounters an object, they are either transmitted, reflected, 
                    absorbed, refracted, polarized, diffracted, or scattered depending on the composition 
                    of the object and the wavelength of the light.<br>

                    Specialized instruments onboard NASA spacecraft and 
                    airplanes collect data on how electromagnetic waves behave when they 
                    interact with matter. These data can reveal the physical and chemical composition of matter.

                    Reflection is when incident light (incoming light) hits an object and bounces off. 
                    Very smooth surfaces such as mirrors reflect almost all incident light.
                    <br>
The color of an object is actually the wavelengths of the light 
reflected while all other wavelengths are absorbed. Color, 
in this case, refers to the different wavelengths of light in the visible 
light spectrum perceived by our eyes. The physical and chemical composition of matter 
determines which wavelength (or color) is reflected.
<br>
This reflective behavior of light is used by lasers onboard NASA's Lunar 
Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the surface of the Moon. 
The instrument measures the time it takes a laser pulse to hit the surface and return. 
The longer the response time, the farther away the surface and lower the elevation. 
A shorter response time means the surface is closer or higher in elevation.

                <p class="spam">
                    Absorption occurs when photons from incident light hit atoms and molecules and cause them to vibrate. 
                    The more an object's molecules move and vibrate, the hotter it becomes. 
                    This heat is then emitted from the object as thermal energy.<br>
                    Some objects, such as darker colored objects, absorb more incident light energy than others. 
                    For example, black pavement absorbs most visible and UV energy and reflects very little, 
                    while a light-colored concrete sidewalk reflects more energy than it absorbs. 
                    Thus, the black pavement is hotter than the sidewalk on a hot summer day. 
                    Photons bounce around during this absorption process and lose bits of energy to numerous molecules along the way. 
                    This thermal energy then radiates in the form of longer wavelength infrared energy.<br>
                    Thermal radiation from the energy-absorbing asphalt and roofs in a city can raise its surface temperature 
                    by as much as 10° Celsius. The Landsat 7 satellite image below shows the city of Atlanta 
                    as an island of heat compared to the surrounding area. Sometimes this warming of air above 
                    cities can influence weather, 
                    which is called the "urban heat island" effect.

                            Diffraction is the bending and spreading of waves around an obstacle. 
                            It is most pronounced when a light wave strikes an object with a size comparable to its own wavelength. 
                            An instrument called a spectrometer uses diffraction to separate light into a range of wavelengths—a spectrum.
                             In the case of visible light, 
                            the separation of wavelengths through diffraction results in a rainbow.<br>
                            A spectrometer uses diffraction (and the subsequent interference) of light from 
                            slits or gratings to separate wavelengths. Faint peaks of energy at specific wavelengths 
                            can then be detected and recorded. A graph of these data is called a spectral signature. 
                            Patterns in a spectral signature help scientists identify 
                            the physical condition and composition of stellar and interstellar matter.<br>

                                    Scattering occurs when light bounces off an object in a variety of directions. 
                                    The amount of scattering that takes place depends on the 
                                    wavelength of the light and the size and structure of the object.<br>
                                    The sky appears blue because of this scattering behavior. 
                                    Light at shorter wavelengths—blue and violet—is scattered by nitrogen and oxygen as
                                     it passes through the atmosphere. Longer wavelengths of light—red and 
                                     yellow—transmit through the atmosphere. This scattering of light at shorter 
                                     wavelengths illuminates the skies with light from the blue and violet end of the visible spectrum. 
                                     Even though violet is scattered more than blue,
                                     the sky looks blue to us because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light.<br>
                                     Aerosols in the atmosphere can also scatter light. NASA's Cloud-Aerosol 
                                     Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite can observe 
                                     the scattering of laser pulses to "see" the distributions of aerosols from sources such
                                      as dust storms and forest fires. The image below shows a volcanic ash cloud drifting over Europe 
                                     from an eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull Volcano in 2010.

                                            Refraction is when light waves change direction as
                                             they pass from one medium to another. 
                                             Light travels slower in air than in a vacuum, 
                                             and even slower in water. As light travels into a different medium, 
                                             the change in speed bends the light. Different wavelengths of light 
                                             are slowed at different rates, which causes them to bend at different angles.
